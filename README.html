<h2>About</h2>

<p>An employeeâ€™s product knowledge is an important selling tool. Employees who are knowledgeable about the products they sell are able to answer customer questions more efficiently; building credibility and store loyalty while boosting sales and educating themselves at the same time. Product training is expensive, time consuming, and with hundreds of seasonal products and the popularity of special diets it can be nearly impossible to keep up to date. Customers of specialty markets are well educated and want to know more about their food. Where was this product sourced? Is it gluten free, low glycemic, or vegan? Two thirds of customers still prefer to speak to an employee when they have a product question over consulting a kiosk, handout, or their devices.</p>

<p>Gather solves this problem by providing an easy to use system that employees can access anywhere on their mobile devices or a store provided device. Products can be searched for by name, category or department. Information includes price, other varieties, description, department, location in the store, special diet considerations, distribution/source, and how to use or cook the product</p>
